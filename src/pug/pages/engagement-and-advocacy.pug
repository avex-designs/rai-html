          p The RAI Group of companies’ advocacy is in line with the principles discussed more fully in our Guiding Principles, the policy positions discussed in the Transforming Tobacco section on this website, or otherwise in the interests of the organization.
          p The RAI Group participates in the political and public policy process in a manner consistent with the law and the interests of our businesses, but our participation is not, as a matter of policy, based on any officer's or employee's personal political preferences. We are engaged and collaborative with a diverse group of legislators and stakeholders at the federal, state and local levels, even when we may not necessarily agree with all of the positions taken by each candidate or organization to which we contribute.

          p As with many organizations our size, we retain the services of government relations consultants at various political levels, as appropriate. Contracted lobbyists, and staff members registered to lobby, engage with elected officials and their staffs to communicate the companies’ viewpoints and perspectives on legislative and public policy matters. Such engagement is undertaken at the direction of the External Affairs staff for the RAI Group, under the supervision and approval of the executive vice president of External Affairs. Lobbying expenses are disclosed in filings with appropriate federal and state agencies in accordance with applicable laws.
