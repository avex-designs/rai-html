    p Richard Joshua Reynolds lived less than a year at Reynolda House and Gardens, the country estate that he and his wife Katherine built in Winston-Salem, N.C., in 1917. But if R.J. could visit Reynolda today, he would no doubt be both proud and amazed by the legacy his family left for the public, which the company he founded in 1875 continues to support today.
    p In 2017, Reynolda House Museum of American Art marked its centennial as an estate and its 50th anniversary as a public museum that today features the Southeast’s finest collection of American art – a premier collection of masterpieces that span three centuries.
    p Continuing the strong spirit of community support that R.J. himself established during his lifetime, Reynolds American has long been a strong corporate member of Reynolda House, including contributions in 2017 to help revitalize Reynolda Gardens and to support the Centennial Ball, which helped fund Georgia O’Keeffe: Living Modern, a major exhibition celebrating the American modernist’s life, sensibilities and art. Other well-known artists’ work that the museum has exhibited in recent years includes Frederic Church and J.C. Leyendecker.
    p “RAI and Reynolda share the same roots. Doing good work in the community was always at the forefront of the Reynolds’ minds—from teaching the latest agricultural techniques to local farmers to building a school to educate the community’s youth. Our community strength stems from Richard Joshua and Katharine Reynolds. A century later, RAI’s community support continues this support and they are a wonderful corporate partner.”
