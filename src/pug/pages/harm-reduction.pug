      h2 Tobacco Harm Reduction (THR) is about reducing the risks faced by adult tobacco smokers by providing them with accurate information about, and instituting regulatory policies that reflect, the comparative risks between cigarettes and non-combustible tobacco products and nicotine replacement therapies — thereby encouraging smokers who do not quit tobacco entirely to consider switching to these tobacco products.

        p In response to the Surgeon General’s report in 1964, governments, at all levels, deployed a range of strategies to encourage smokers to quit and to discourage smoking initiation. Smoking rates have reached historic lows. Specifically, adult smoking has declined significantly from 42.4 percent at its peak to 15.1 percent (1965–2015). However, despite near-universal awareness of the health risks associated with cigarettes, the CDC reports that 37 million American adults continue to smoke.
        p Recently, some members of the public health community have advocated that tobacco harm reduction be included as part of a more comprehensive strategy for reducing the health risks associated with cigarette smoking. Harm reduction encourages public health initiatives that have the potential to decrease the harm associated with a particular behavior without necessarily eliminating that behavior. That is not to say that the alternative behavior does not pose some risk, but they believe that the alternative behavior likely poses less risk. Common harm-reduction efforts that minimize the impact risky behaviors have on society include laws concerning road safety (e.g. seatbelt, helmet and cell phone/texting laws), and needle exchanges for intravenous drug users.

        p Given the success of harm reduction strategies with other risky behaviors, a growing number of scientists and public health officials are embracing tobacco harm reduction as an additional tool to reduce the harm associated with cigarette use. Many believe that migrating smokers who are not interested in quitting smoking from cigarettes to non-combustible tobacco products and nicotine replacement therapies presents a public health opportunity.
        p Research indicates that the combustion of tobacco (i.e., cigarette smoking), rather than nicotine, is what exposes tobacco consumers to the most risk. Indeed, there is a scientific consensus that smokeless tobacco products present less risk than cigarettes. There is a growing body of scientific evidence that other non-combustible tobacco products such as vapor products may present less risk than cigarette smoking as well. Encouraging smokers to switch to products that reduce the risk, or have the potential to reduce risk, from smoking cigarettes can play a valuable role in public health.

            li Promoting awareness and use of our Right Decisions Right Now: Be Tobacco Free program (RDRN);
            li Number of our employee-led RDRN presentations;

            li Legislation passed to prevent minors from purchasing, using and possessing tobacco products, including next generation products.
          p Our efforts are a collaboration among engaged stakeholder groups including employees, trade partners, educators, government officials, non-profit organizations and consumers.
          p Our commitment is to keep youth tobacco prevention at the forefront of our efforts as we pursue our vision of transforming the tobacco industry. It is the right thing to do for our society and it is the right thing for our businesses.

          p Reynolds American’s subsidiaries are adding to a growing body of science demonstrating that smokeless tobacco products present less risk than cigarettes and that other non-combustible tobacco products that are much newer to the market, such as vapor products, may present significantly less risk than cigarettes. The varying risks presented by these products can be viewed as a risk continuum. Misunderstandings of this risk continuum create barriers to millions of smokers living better lives — smoke-free.

          p A growing body of scientific research demonstrates a continuum of risk associated with tobacco products. RAI’s operating companies are working to innovate and introduce new products with the potential to reduce these risks, while continuing to meet the changing expectations of adult tobacco consumers. This approach begins with the principle that nothing is to be done or added to products that increases their inherent risks.
