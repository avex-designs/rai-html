          p In addition to monetary donations, the RAI Group remains committed to ensuring that our companies’ formerly used facilities continue to play a vital role in economic development. Our giving heritage began with Richard Joshua Reynolds and his family’s donations of land and buildings to organizations such as Wake Forest University. In later years, our donations of land and property have led to the redevelopment of portions of downtown Winston-Salem to what is the now-vibrant Innovation Quarter, as well as the development of the former Whitaker Park manufacturing site.
          h5.h5-like Arts & culture
          p The RAI Group and its foundations support preserving and promoting arts and culture, as well as preserving the history of our communities. The arts are vital to the vibrancy of our communities, benefit our current and future employees, and contribute to our local economies.
