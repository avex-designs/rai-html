          h5.text-headline Adult Audience
          p This website is intended only for use by adults. Reynolds American Inc. (RAI) and its operating companies believe that youth should not use tobacco products. Our companies take no actions to encourage youth tobacco use, and support programs designed to discourage and reduce youth use. In addition, RAI and its operating companiesâ€™ correspondence policies are designed to limit business communications to adults only. We take these issues and responsibilities very seriously. Linking to this site from any site is expressly prohibited without permission.
          h5.text-headline Unsolicited Ideas
          p Although RAI appreciates people's interest in its business, it is our policy to decline consideration of unsolicited ideas and suggestions offered or submitted by the general public. RAI relies on its staff for the generation and implementation of new concepts. This is necessary in order to avoid misunderstandings over the origin of particular ideas. RAI does not accept unsolicited ideas for consideration, and asks you not to submit ideas.
          h5.text-headline Student Requests
          p Reynolds American Inc. has a longstanding corporate policy of not sending information on its business to students, as part of our commitment to directing brand-related communications to adult audiences and avoiding a tobacco-marketing presence in classrooms. RAI does not reply to any requests from students, unless they are seeking information on youth non-smoking programs. Anyone interested in RJR Tobacco's youth non-smoking programs should visit RJR Tobacco's separate "Right Decisions, Right Now" Web site: #[a(href="http://www.rightdecisionsrightnow.com/" target="_blank") www.rightdecisionsrightnow.com].
